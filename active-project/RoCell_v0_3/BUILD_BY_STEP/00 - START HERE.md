# RoCell RC03 — Start Here

This is the operator-facing sequence for `RC03-INT-R1`. The CAD, configuration, ledgers, drawings, and print controls remain canonical in their original project folders. Each step contains direct links/hashes plus hash-verified STL convenience copies so operators can work by step without creating a second manufacturing master.

**Physical state:** `UNRELEASED`  
**Active build ID:** `2026-09-01_CELL-A`  
**Print readiness:** 5 READY / 15 WAITING / 4 NOT_SELECTED  
**Package definition hash:** `7a6947f2de52f63133c5b9647b9b479ccd9d896906c2b575e76c106e1e5dccca`  
**Canonical snapshot hash:** `05d11599e6d4a2937e0207535b298aa809ff08c79840350c7716666ce6d12755`  
**Selected routes:** phone stylus=True, keyboard rod=True, fixed-mast camera fallback=False (selection is not release)

## How to use this folder

1. Read [the complete build order](<01 - COMPLETE BUILD ORDER.md>), then open Step 00 as the first non-complete step (a new build starts at Step 00).
2. In each step, open `00 - START HERE.md` and follow its numbered file map.
3. Follow [how to save measurements and photos](<02 - HOW TO SAVE MEASUREMENTS AND PHOTOS.md>), set one active build ID, and initialize only a step that is `READY TO START`.
4. Use the exact usage label in each step's `03 - STL MODELS` folder. Canonical project-level `stl/` files remain authoritative.
5. Open manufacturing controls only through `99 - TECHNICAL RECORDS - DO NOT EDIT/OPEN CONTROLLED FILES.md`; do not create editable forks.
6. Print jobs are produced only in Step 00. Later assembly steps consume accepted, labeled parts and include STL/job files for recovery and traceability.
7. Record raw measurements and original evidence. A checkmark without an in-limit value is not PASS.
8. Use [part names and technical terms](<03 - PART NAMES AND TECHNICAL TERMS.md>) whenever a term is unfamiliar.
9. If a source or local STL hash changes, regenerate and revalidate before continuing.

## Persistent orientation

- Origin: front-left corner of the finished board top.
- +X is right, +Y is rear/toward the arm, and +Z is up.
- Blue denotes locators/controlled geometry, orange denotes hardware/action, and red denotes STOP/no-go conditions.

## Canonical controls

- [Illustrated assembly guide](<../output/pdf/RC03_ILLUSTRATED_ASSEMBLY_GUIDE.pdf>)
- [Detailed assembly manual](<../ASSEMBLY_MANUAL.pdf>)
- [Print readiness](<../PRINT_READINESS.md>)
- [Build tracker](<../BUILD_TRACKER.md>)
- [BOM](<../BOM.csv>)
- [Fastener map](<../FASTENER_MAP.csv>)
- [Job kits](<../JOB_KITS.csv>)

## Open decisions and controlled change triggers

- Supply and measure the exact arm-mounted camera/interface specification before Step 13; the separate fixed mast is a selected but unqualified fallback only.
- Complete the blank selected-length, anchor-type, and final-board-bore fields in FASTENER_MAP.csv from physical cutoff tests before final board drilling.
- Select and document a rated E-stop implementation and board-to-bench anti-shift method before Step 15 commissioning.
- Transfer every accepted coupon value through its dedicated key in `user_overrides.example.json`, then regenerate and prove the geometry-parameter mapping before production.
- Store diagnostic native QIDI projects in the build-ID evidence folder; the canonical `--qidi-job` gate records non-diagnostic release jobs only.

`tmp/` is scratch/QA output and is never build evidence.
