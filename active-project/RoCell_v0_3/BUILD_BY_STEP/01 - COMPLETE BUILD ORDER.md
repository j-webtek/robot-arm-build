# RoCell RC03 — Complete Build Order

Follow these folders in numeric order. Step 00 produces and accepts the printed parts; Steps 01-15 assemble and prove the cell. Never skip a LOCKED state, HOLD, or STOP condition.

**Current physical state:** UNRELEASED. Digital completion does not itself authorize physical release.

**Current sequence status:** 0/16 steps COMPLETE; Step 00 is the first non-complete step and is **HOLD**.

**Active build ID:** `2026-09-01_CELL-A`. Set it before recording any evidence.

Safe path: choose routes and one build ID → measure real hardware → print diagnostics → record results → regenerate and validate → print only READY jobs → inspect and kit → assemble Steps 01-15 in order.

Read [how to save measurements and photos](<02 - HOW TO SAVE MEASUREMENTS AND PHOTOS.md>) and [part names and technical terms](<03 - PART NAMES AND TECHNICAL TERMS.md>) before beginning.

## Step 00 — Measure Hardware and Print Approved Parts

**Goal:** Measure the real hardware, qualify each exact material/profile, print only released jobs, and stage accepted parts before touching the finished board.

**Done when:** All required coupons, first articles, production parts, hardware kits, and native QIDI Studio records are accepted and traceable.

**Step-00 qualification/production STL copies:** 32; use only through a READY job.

Open: [00 — Start Here](<00 - Measure Hardware and Print Approved Parts/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Do not fabricate the board or install a station while any required core job is WAITING, any first article is unaccepted, any actual-device measurement is missing, or any independently selected coupon value is not represented by its dedicated CAD parameter.

## Step 01 — Seal Mark and Drill the Board

**Goal:** Create the flat, sealed, accurately indexed structural board using only a 1:1 paper template, hand drill, guides, and depth stops.

**Done when:** A cured 610 x 457 x 18 mm board with four blind locator interfaces and nine qualified M4 anchor interfaces, all inspected and labeled.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 12; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [01 — Start Here](<01 - Seal Mark and Drill the Board/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Stop before center transfer or drilling if the board misses any released cut-size, thickness, opposite-edge, diagonal, flatness, or bow limit; any X/Y scale control is wrong; a Letter tile is butted instead of overlapped by 12 mm; registration or edge checks disagree; a station first article is unaccepted; a locator cannot meet both 15.00 +/- 0.20 mm depth and 2.00 mm minimum floor; or any anchor lacks a completed qualified FASTENER_MAP row and scrap-board proof.

## Step 02 — Reinforce Board and Clamp Robot Arm

**Goal:** Spread the factory RoArm clamp load with measured precut metal while keeping the factory clamp as the load-bearing interface.

**Done when:** The board remains flat and stable under the factory clamp, with reinforcement, feet, anchors, and motion volume clear of one another.

**STL requirement:** none for this step.

Open: [02 — Start Here](<02 - Reinforce Board and Clamp Robot Arm/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** The clamp illustration is schematic and there is no released plate CAD. Do not fabricate from the picture; use the measured physical clamp footprint and stop if the board bows or any anchor is obstructed.

## Step 03 — Install Left Keyboard Base

**Goal:** Establish the keyboard coordinate system from the left/master station's round and radial locator pair.

**Done when:** The left station is squarely seated on two pins and three board interfaces, with its padded slider captured, parked fully rearward, and not loading a keyboard.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 6; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [03 — Start Here](<03 - Install Left Keyboard Base/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Do not force either locator, omit the slider from the shared stack, or tighten the shared screw as a device clamp before the keyboard is loaded.

## Step 04 — Install Right Keyboard Base

**Goal:** Extend the keyboard support from the master seam without creating a second, conflicting locator system.

**Done when:** The right/slave station is seam-located, held by three relieved board interfaces, flush with the master, and free of rocking.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 7; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [04 — Start Here](<04 - Install Right Keyboard Base/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Do not drill or add right-side locator pins. If the seam does not seat by hand, remove the slave and find the interference instead of pulling it together with screws.

## Step 05 — Place and Secure Keyboard

**Goal:** Seat the keyboard directly on the finished board and use the two guided sliders only for gentle retention.

**Done when:** The keyboard rests without rock or case distortion, both pads touch gently, and the cable remains clear.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 3; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [05 — Start Here](<05 - Place and Secure Keyboard/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** The sliders are retainers, not force clamps. Stop immediately if the keyboard bows, a foot lifts, a cable is pinched, or either slider binds.

## Step 06 — Install Phone and Tool Station

**Goal:** Establish the phone/TCP coordinate system from its round and radial locator pair before the shared service rail is added.

**Done when:** The combined station is seated on two pins with only the TCP-side retainer installed; both rail-side interfaces remain open.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 7; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [06 — Start Here](<06 - Install Phone and Tool Station/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Do not install either rail-side board screw before the rail is fully seated. Do not heat-set inserts while the station is mounted on the finished board.

## Step 07 — Fit Phone Rail and Tool Cartridge

**Goal:** Locate the replaceable phone rail on its keys and place the keyed TCP cartridge before any shared or cartridge fastener is installed.

**Done when:** The rail lies flat on both keys and the cartridge is fully seated in its only valid orientation, with all holes aligned.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 11; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [07 — Start Here](<07 - Fit Phone Rail and Tool Cartridge/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Do not install shared rail screws or cartridge screws until both parts sit fully flush by hand. Never pull a misaligned part into place with hardware.

## Step 08 — Secure Phone Rail and Tool Cartridge

**Goal:** Lock the already seated rail and cartridge with the correct shared board, clamp-nut, and TCP fastener sequence.

**Done when:** All three station anchors, both clamp nuts, and both TCP screws are installed without lifting the rail or distorting the cartridge datum.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 3; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [08 — Start Here](<08 - Secure Phone Rail and Tool Cartridge/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Stop if a shared M4 stack lifts the rail, a clamp nut spins or cracks its tower, or an M3 screw changes cartridge height or flushness.

## Step 09 — Place Phone and Route USB Cable

**Goal:** Seat the measured phone/case, retain the USB lead with a relaxed bend, and advance only accepted soft clamp tips.

**Done when:** The phone is repeatably seated, the USB connector is unstressed, the cable exits forward through the saddle, and the soft tips touch safe case regions.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 12; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [09 — Start Here](<09 - Place Phone and Route USB Cable/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Stop if the connector carries load, the tie changes the bend radius, a tip approaches glass or a side feature, or clamp pressure shifts the phone.

## Step 10 — Check Phone Clearances

**Goal:** Prove the actual clamp and cable positions clear the screen edge, camera bump, side buttons, and USB connector envelope.

**Done when:** Measured keepout margins are recorded for the real phone/case, and both clamp axes and the cable route remain outside all no-go zones.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 3; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [10 — Start Here](<10 - Check Phone Clearances/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** The red regions in the illustration are not released dimensions. Stop and revise the measured clamp centers or cable route if any actual feature lacks a positive recorded margin.

## Step 11 — Mark AprilTag Locations

**Goal:** Use the verified paper template only to transfer six centers and orientation marks onto the cured board.

**Done when:** All six tag centers and +Y/rear orientation marks are visible on the board, and all paper has been removed before adhesive work.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 1; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [11 — Start Here](<11 - Mark AprilTag Locations/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Do not glue through the paper. Stop if the guide route/path/hash differs from Step 00, either scale bar is wrong, a Letter tile uses pages 1-3 or is butted instead of overlapped by 12 mm with matching IDs, the full-size page is cropped/scaled, the template is stretched, FRONT/+Y is ambiguous, or any transferred center cannot be reconciled to the coordinate CSV.

## Step 12 — Attach and Measure AprilTags

**Goal:** Apply IDs 0-5 directly to the cured board with full-surface matte adhesive and measure their installed optical geometry.

**Done when:** Six correctly oriented tags are flat and physically measured, and a measured-installation runtime map is generated for Step 13; the application frame is removed and stored.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 1; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [12 — Start Here](<12 - Attach and Measure AprilTags/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Stop if a tile is glossy, scaled, damaged, rotated, misidentified, only spot-taped, or outside placement limits. Do not leave the printed application frame on the board.

## Step 13 — Mount and Calibrate Camera

**Goal:** After the camera architecture is formally aligned, mount the exact measured camera, calibrate it with the route-specific transform method, and prove the required view, timing, cable, payload, and collision envelope. The fixed six-tag eye-to-hand procedure below is retained only as the current independent-mast fallback.

**Done when:** The camera architecture no longer conflicts with config/camera_architecture_decision.json; the exact mount, camera, cable, calibration chain, visibility set, and motion consequences are controlled and physically accepted.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 7; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [13 — Start Here](<13 - Mount and Calibrate Camera/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Stop while config/camera_architecture_decision.json is ENGINEERING_ALIGNMENT_HOLD. The user-intended arm-mounted architecture is not released by the fixed-camera illustration, mast files, plate, or eye-to-hand commands. After formal alignment, also stop if the exact support is unmeasured, the camera moves, a screw can bottom, the moving cable is unqualified, the calibrated transform method does not match the mount architecture, or any route-required target leaves its accepted view.

## Step 14 — Assemble and Test Spring-Loaded Tool

**Goal:** Build and qualify every selected contact-tool route around the shared compliant body, one configuration at a time, and verify travel, force, retention, function, and TCP repeatability.

**Done when:** Each selected rod/TPU and/or stylus configuration has smooth controlled travel, returns freely, remains retained, functions correctly, and has a recorded calibrated TCP.

**Traceability-only STL copies:** 13; do not print during this assembly step.

Open: [14 — Start Here](<14 - Assemble and Test Spring-Loaded Tool/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** This is a contact tool, not a hard stop. Stop if travel binds, the spring coil-binds, the cap distorts, the adapter slips, or the selected contact route is not explicitly recorded.

## Step 15 — Final Safety Test and Release

**Goal:** Prove the assembled cell mechanically, visually, and functionally before any automatic contact with the keyboard or phone.

**Done when:** Every acceptance gate has measured evidence, the cell passes empty motion and controlled first contact, and a responsible person signs the physical release decision.

**STL requirement:** none for this step.

Open: [15 — Start Here](<15 - Final Safety Test and Release/00 - START HERE.md>)

> **STOP:** Digital PASS is not physical release. Do not enable automatic device contact until every measured gate is in limit, evidence is archived, the E-stop works, and the physical release decision is signed.
