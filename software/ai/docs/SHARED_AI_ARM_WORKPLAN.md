# Shared AI-to-arm workplan and evidence backbone

**Status:** active coordination document  
**Owners:** AI/model workstream and arm/runtime workstream  
**Started:** 2026-09-26  
**Repository:** `j-webtek/robot-arm-build`  
**Current baseline commit:** `ebe7eee` (`docs: establish shared AI arm workplan`)  
**Authority:** this document coordinates development; it grants no hardware authority

## Purpose

This is the common working backbone for two independently advancing workstreams:

1. **AI/model lane:** understand the user's request, assess the scene, localize
   named targets, quantify uncertainty, and emit an ordered proposal batch.
2. **Arm/runtime lane:** admit that batch, bind it to measured state and
   calibration, plan a smooth safe trajectory, execute through one controlled
   writer, and independently verify the result.

The lanes may develop and test independently. Neither lane may declare an
integration stage complete by itself. A stage completes only when the AI lane,
the arm lane, and the shared integration gate each have committed evidence.

This document is intentionally shared and append-friendly. Workers update only
their owned lane fields, add evidence rows rather than rewriting history, and
use the integration gate to expose contract drift early.

## Common product objective

Given a supported user instruction and fresh observations, produce the intended
physical device interaction efficiently, repeatably, and safely, while preserving
the distinction between:

- what the user requested;
- what the AI inferred and proposed;
- what deterministic planning admitted;
- what bytes the controller received;
- what the arm reported doing; and
- what an independent observer verified actually happened.

The target architecture is:

```text
User request
  -> grounded semantic intent
  -> deterministic ActionPlan
  -> scene and target observations
  -> qualified ModelMotionBatch
  -> strict deterministic ingress
  -> fresh observed arm state
  -> measured reprojection, IK, limits, and collision screening
  -> sealed TrajectoryExecutionEnvelope
  -> single-use execution permit
  -> sole controller writer and correlated receipt
  -> settle verification
  -> independent task outcome verification
  -> next action, completion, or explicit stop
```

## Non-negotiable shared invariants

These rules apply to both lanes and may not be weakened to improve benchmark
scores or latency:

1. The AI/model boundary ends at `ModelMotionBatch`. A model never emits joint
   angles, PWM, Waveshare protocol JSON, serial bytes, permits, or write authority.
2. User text is compiled into a deterministic `ActionPlan`; every motion batch
   binds the exact `plan_hash` and preserves action order and repetitions.
3. Every coordinate declares its frame and metric units. No implicit frame,
   pixel-to-millimetre assumption, or undocumented axis convention is accepted.
4. Perception uncertainty and observation confidence are distinct values.
   Qualification coverage is not silently reused as per-observation confidence.
5. Image, scene, calibration, build, configuration, target-map, controller
   session, and tool/TCP identities are content-bound where applicable.
6. Every physical action begins from a fresh authenticated arm-state read.
   Action N+1 is not planned from action N's old starting state.
7. Deterministic arm code owns IK, limits, collision screening, motion timing,
   speed, acceleration, jerk, settling, contact policy, and controller encoding.
8. One process owns the writable controller transport. Every accepted execution
   has a unique correlation ID and a durable pre-dispatch boundary.
9. An ambiguous dispatch or outcome is never retried automatically.
10. Servo arrival does not prove task success. Independent device outcome
    evidence is required before advancing a multi-action task.
11. A passing synthetic study, simulation, schema test, or shadow encoding is
    identified as such and never described as physical qualification.
12. Phone state-changing actions require new scene evidence after each action.
    Keyboard batch reuse requires a still-valid scene lease and fixed-device
    evidence.

## Ownership boundary

| Artifact or decision | AI/model lane owns | Arm/runtime lane owns | Shared gate checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raw text interpretation | Proposed intent and abstention | Supported capability lookup | Exact intent survives compilation |
| `ActionPlan` | Consumes compiler output | Deterministic compiler/profile | Plan hash and ordered actions |
| Scene assessment | Visibility, obstruction, quality | Required evidence policy | Freshness and domain identity |
| Target localization | Named target, coordinate, uncertainty | Measured frame validation | Target bound fits safe region |
| `ModelMotionBatch` | Produces canonical batch | Strict decode and admission | Round-trip bytes and hash equality |
| Motion policy | May provide bounded intent hints only | Clearance, timing, dynamics, contact | Hints cannot weaken arm policy |
| Calibration and tool | References required capability | Owns measured transforms and TCP | Exact identity is commissioned |
| Joint trajectory | No ownership | Owns planning and screening | Exact envelope is evidence-bound |
| Controller protocol | No ownership | Owns sole encoder/writer | Correlation and receipt integrity |
| Outcome | May consume verified result | Collects independent evidence | Requested versus observed effect |

## Status vocabulary

Use exactly these status values in the stage table:

- `NOT_STARTED`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`
- `BLOCKED`
- `COMPLETE`

`READY_FOR_INTEGRATION` means one lane has finished its own acceptance criteria.
Only the shared integration gate may change a stage's overall status to
`COMPLETE`.

## Master stage board

| Stage | Deliverable | AI lane | Arm lane | Integration gate | Overall |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| S0 | Shared v1 seam and baseline | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
| S1 | Contract v2: freshness, uncertainty, capability | IN_PROGRESS | READY_FOR_INTEGRATION | COMPLETE | IN_PROGRESS |
| S2 | Full zero-hardware text-to-envelope shadow path | NOT_STARTED | READY_FOR_INTEGRATION | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS |
| S3 | Measured localization and planning readiness | IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | NOT_STARTED | BLOCKED |
| S4 | Zero-write Waveshare adapter and receipts | READY_FOR_INTEGRATION | IN_PROGRESS | NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS |
| S5 | One independently verified physical key action | NOT_STARTED | NOT_STARTED | NOT_STARTED | NOT_STARTED |
| S6 | Ordered multi-action keyboard missions | NOT_STARTED | NOT_STARTED | NOT_STARTED | NOT_STARTED |
| S7 | Performance and operational qualification | NOT_STARTED | NOT_STARTED | NOT_STARTED | NOT_STARTED |
| P1 | Phone capability track | BLOCKED | BLOCKED | NOT_STARTED | BLOCKED |

The S0 status is supported by the shared v1 batch, strict ingress, sequence
coordinator, journal, and focused boundary tests. S2 integration is in progress:
a raw request now traverses the grounded parser, deterministic compiler, actual
v2 emitter, and arm shadow path when given an explicitly scoped synthetic
integration fixture. Qualified perception has not yet supplied that fixture, so
this is not the complete S2 path. S3 remains blocked
from integration because no deployment localization qualification is installed
and the measured planner does not yet reach physical execution admission. S4
lists AI as ready because no new AI authority is required; the arm adapter and
shared byte-level gate remain unfinished.

## Stage definitions

### S0 — Freeze the shared v1 seam

**Goal:** prove both lanes use one ordered, hash-bound model-to-planner contract.

AI lane completion:

- Emit the core `ModelMotionBatch`, not a duplicate AI-only command schema.
- Preserve action order and repeated targets.
- Bind intent, scene, precision, fusion, model, frame, and image identities.
- Emit no controller command or physical authority.

Arm lane completion:

- Strictly decode the same batch type.
- Compare device, plan hash, target order, evidence hashes, confidence, target
  containment, and interaction type.
- Require fresh observed joint state per admitted action.
- Stop before transport access.

Integration evidence:

- Actual emitter output round-trips through shared decoding and ingress.
- Repeated `H`, `H`, `I` remains ordered and unique by proposal ID.
- Current focused boundary suite passes.

**Status:** complete at baseline. Future schema changes must preserve a v1
compatibility fixture or record an explicit migration.

### S1 — Contract v2: freshness, uncertainty, and capability

**Goal:** remove semantic ambiguity before either lane approaches live execution.

AI lane objectives:

- Separate `observation_confidence` from localization qualification coverage.
- Emit a structured uncertainty object containing at least bound type, bound in
  millimetres, coverage probability, qualification hash, and domain ID.
- Bind capture identity and time, evaluation time, expiry/scene lease, model
  identity, target-map identity, and capability profile.
- Bind keyboard placement/orientation through independently evidenced geometry;
  never validate a predicted point against a target rectangle centered from that
  same prediction.
- Keep action coordinates, interaction intent, and target IDs; do not add servo
  or protocol fields.
- Define keyboard frame output as one explicit producer profile. If board-frame
  output remains selected, document how it was derived from image evidence.

Arm lane objectives:

- Strictly decode and validate the new fields without trusting the producer's
  acceptance decision.
- Enforce expiry at ingress and again immediately before planning.
- Validate qualification/domain/capability registries independently.
- Require the entire uncertainty region—not only its center—to fit the measured
  target safe region.
- Treat model speed and clearance as non-authoritative hints, or remove them and
  derive policy entirely from the arm configuration.
- Preserve a migration decoder for frozen v1 fixtures; never guess absent v2
  semantics for live work.

Shared integration gate:

- Canonical AI fixture validates under the published schema and Python decoder.
- Mutations of timestamp, qualification, uncertainty, frame, plan, capability,
  and target-map identities are rejected one at a time.
- Schema validation and runtime validation agree on numeric and index bounds.
- A v2 compatibility matrix is committed with producer and consumer versions.

Completion evidence:

- Contract/schema paths and SHA-256 hashes.
- Exact test command and results.
- Migration behavior for v1.
- Limitations and explicit non-authority statement.

### S2 — Full zero-hardware text-to-envelope shadow path

**Goal:** exercise the real components in order without writing to hardware.

AI lane objectives:

- Accept a raw supported text request through the grounded parser/reference
  interpreter.
- Compile it using the deterministic keyboard compiler.
- Run the selected scene and precision components, including abstention.
- Emit the exact batch consumed by the arm lane.
- Preserve unsupported and clarification outcomes rather than forcing a plan.

Arm lane objectives:

- Decode and admit the actual emitted bytes.
- Create the sequence coordinator and consume a fresh observed-state fixture.
- Run measured reprojection, IK, limits, and route/collision screening.
- Produce a sealed `TrajectoryExecutionEnvelope` when all gates pass, or one
  exact blocker when they do not.
- Generate no Waveshare bytes and perform zero writes.

Shared integration gate:

- One command runs the complete shadow path and emits one trace bundle.
- Trace links raw request hash, plan hash, observation hashes, batch hash,
  ingress hash, planner hash, observed-state hash, and envelope hash.
- Supported, ambiguous, stale, obstructed, out-of-bound, and unsupported cases
  all reach their expected terminal states.
- No test substitutes a hand-authored batch for the actual AI emitter output.

Completion evidence:

- Reproducible command and committed sanitized fixture set.
- End-to-end trace manifest.
- Cross-lane negative test matrix.
- Confirmation of zero hardware access and zero generated wire commands.

### S3 — Measured localization and planning readiness

**Goal:** replace synthetic assumptions with measured deployment evidence.

AI lane objectives:

- Freeze the final camera/domain definition and independent train,
  calibration, and held-out evaluation splits.
- Measure per-target localization error, abstention, obstruction detection, and
  scene-quality rejection from the actual camera geometry.
- Install a qualification only when its declared coverage and target-fit gates
  pass on held-out deployment data.
- Record domains and targets not covered by the qualification.

Arm lane objectives:

- Commission camera, board, device placement, robot base, and tool/TCP
  transforms with validity and expiry.
- Complete installed geometry, cable, keyboard, board, and exclusion-volume
  models needed for continuous collision screening.
- Demonstrate the planner's reserved ready status from fresh measured state,
  without encoding or transmitting commands.
- Measure joint limits and conservative velocity, acceleration, jerk, and
  settling limits.

Shared integration gate:

- Actual held-out camera observations produce v2 batches whose uncertainty
  regions fit named targets after measured reprojection.
- Those exact batches reach sealed trajectory envelopes from fresh state.
- Deliberately moved keyboard, stale calibration, wrong tool, occlusion, and
  out-of-domain images fail closed.
- Qualification and calibration artifacts remain separately identifiable.

Completion evidence:

- Qualification and calibration artifact hashes.
- Held-out scorecards and target coverage list.
- Planner-ready trace with zero hardware writes.
- Failure evidence for every required negative case.

### S4 — Zero-write controller adapter and correlated receipts

**Goal:** prove exact protocol encoding and execution lifecycle without sending.

AI lane objectives:

- Keep the batch contract stable and consume arm capability information only
  through the supported capability profile.
- Add no controller-specific fields.
- Verify model-side tests still pass against the adapter's supported action set.

Arm lane objectives:

- Implement a zero-write Waveshare encoder that accepts only a sealed,
  unexpired `TrajectoryExecutionEnvelope` plus a separate single-use permit.
- Define how timed waypoints map to the controller's actual command semantics.
- Define fixed-gripper/tool behavior explicitly.
- Reject stale sessions, duplicate correlation IDs, expired deadlines, altered
  envelopes, unsupported interpolation, and unmeasured limits.
- Build a sole-writer lifecycle and a content-bound receipt format covering
  submitted bytes, acknowledgements, feedback, timeouts, and closure.

Shared integration gate:

- Golden byte fixtures are deterministic and reviewable.
- Decode/encode units and joint ordering agree with the commissioned controller.
- Duplicate, stale, altered, partial-write, timeout, and restart cases fail
  without automatic resend.
- Test instrumentation proves transport write count remains zero.

Completion evidence:

- Encoder source and golden fixtures.
- Controller protocol/version citation or pinned vendor artifact.
- Receipt and permit schemas.
- Fault-injection results with zero physical writes.

### S5 — One independently verified physical key action

**Goal:** demonstrate one admitted model-originated key interaction end to end.

AI lane objectives:

- Produce one qualified target proposal from a fresh deployment observation.
- Abstain when any required scene, domain, confidence, or uncertainty condition
  is not satisfied.
- Retain the exact user request and plan lineage.

Arm lane objectives:

- Execute exactly one admitted envelope through the sole writer.
- Monitor tracking, limits, deadline, and settling throughout the action.
- Retract safely and preserve torque policy.
- Produce one execution receipt and independent keyboard outcome observation.
- Never retry an uncertain dispatch or outcome.

Shared integration gate:

- Requested key, proposed target, transmitted command, feedback, and observed
  character are separately recorded and agree.
- A failed or uncertain outcome terminates without a second press.
- Physical test approval, cleared workspace, build identity, and stop reason are
  recorded outside this plan in the run evidence.

Completion evidence:

- Sanitized physical run manifest and receipt hashes.
- Independent outcome artifact.
- Tracking/settling metrics and discrepancies.
- Explicit count of physical writes and movements.

### S6 — Ordered multi-action keyboard missions

**Goal:** execute supported strings smoothly while preserving per-action safety.

AI lane objectives:

- Preserve exact text, action order, repetitions, punctuation, and unsupported
  character handling.
- Define when a fixed-keyboard scene lease may span multiple actions and when a
  new observation is mandatory.
- Never repair or reorder a plan based on convenient geometry.

Arm lane objectives:

- Advance only after verified completion of the preceding action.
- Read fresh arm state for each action while caching only immutable geometry.
- Optimize safe hover-to-hover transitions, planner warm-up, and settled motion
  without bypassing ingress or outcome checks.
- Recover from restart through the durable journal without replaying an
  uncertain action.

Shared integration gate:

- Held-out strings cover repeated keys, rows, numbers, punctuation, space, and
  enter within the supported profile.
- Requested and independently observed output match exactly.
- Fault injection covers device movement, stale lease, dropped feedback,
  process restart, and ambiguous outcome.

Completion evidence:

- Mission corpus and held-out definition.
- Exact-match outcome scorecard.
- Per-action lineage and latency breakdown.
- Restart and fault-injection reports.

### S7 — Performance and operational qualification

**Goal:** improve speed only after correctness and recovery are demonstrated.

AI lane objectives:

- Measure intent, scene, precision, fusion, and emission latency separately.
- Reduce inference latency without changing qualification semantics.
- Track abstention, false acceptance, coordinate error, and domain drift.

Arm lane objectives:

- Measure ingress, planning, encoding, dispatch, travel, settling, observation,
  and total action latency separately.
- Tune trajectories under measured limits and tracking error budgets.
- Add watchdog, cancellation, operator stop, and bounded resource behavior.

Shared integration gate:

- Publish p50/p95/p99 latency, exact outcome rate, tracking error, abstention,
  transport fault, and recovery metrics on held-out missions.
- Demonstrate that performance changes do not reduce safety-gate coverage.
- Freeze supported device/task/camera/tool profiles for the qualified release.

Completion evidence:

- Qualification report and release commit.
- Reproducible benchmark commands and environment identity.
- Regression thresholds enforced in CI.
- Remaining limitations and unsupported capabilities.

### P1 — Separate phone capability track

Phone work does not inherit keyboard readiness automatically. It requires:

- named screen states and legal transitions;
- a fresh observation after every state-changing tap;
- screen-local coordinates and measured screen placement;
- independent state verification before the next tap;
- explicit support for dialer navigation, number entry, call initiation, and
  cancellation; and
- its own held-out perception, planning, execution, and outcome qualification.

Until those gates exist, phone requests remain `unsupported_by_profile` or
blocked at the batch emitter.

## Shared contract-v2 design record

S1 owns the exact schema, but both workers must design against these semantics:

```text
ModelMotionBatchV2
  identity:
    batch_id, request_id, plan_hash, device, capability_profile
  evidence:
    frame_id, image_hash, capture_time, evaluation_time, expiry/scene_lease
    scene_hash, precision_hash, fusion_hash, model_id
  qualification:
    domain_id, qualification_hash, target_map_hash
    coverage_probability, error_bound_mm, bound_type
  actions[]:
    proposal_id, target_id, coordinate_frame, target_mm, interaction
    observation_confidence
  prohibited:
    joint targets, PWM, controller JSON, serial bytes, transport identity,
    execution permit, physical authority
```

This block is a semantic design target, not yet the authoritative schema.
Committed schema and decoder changes must link their evidence below.

## Required shared test matrix

Every contract or runtime change must preserve tests for:

| Category | Required cases |
|---|---|
| Intent | supported literal, ambiguity, extra operation, unsupported character, wrong device |
| Ordering | repeated key, punctuation, multi-row sequence, altered order, missing action |
| Provenance | altered plan, image, model, scene, precision, fusion, target map, qualification |
| Freshness | fresh, expired, future timestamp, moved device, changed scene lease |
| Geometry | center, safe-edge bound, uncertainty crossing edge, wrong frame, wrong plane |
| Capability | unsupported profile, wrong tool/TCP, phone through keyboard-only path |
| Arm state | fresh state, stale state, reused state, wrong controller session |
| Trajectory | joint limit, velocity, acceleration, jerk, collision, deadline, settling |
| Transport | duplicate correlation, partial write, timeout, stale session, restart |
| Outcome | verified, failed before dispatch, ambiguous after dispatch, mismatched character |
| Authority | no model servo fields, no wire bytes before permit, no automatic retry |

## Evidence ledger rules

1. Evidence rows are append-only. Never edit an old failure into a pass.
2. Corrections receive a new evidence ID and reference the superseded row.
3. Every row names one repository commit and one exact test/evaluation command.
4. Store large or structured artifacts in the appropriate committed evidence or
   evaluation directory; link them here rather than pasting raw output.
5. Mark `hardware_writes` and `physical_movements` explicitly, including zero.
6. Do not commit credentials, private settings, raw authorization material, or
   unsanitized user data.
7. A lane may set itself to `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION` after its acceptance criteria
   pass. Only a cross-lane evidence row may complete the integration gate.

## Active work claims

Workers add a short row before beginning a potentially overlapping change and
remove it only in the same commit that appends the resulting evidence row.

| Worker/lane | Stage | Paths expected to change | Branch/commit | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unclaimed | S2 | qualified perception adapter and complete shared gate | — | AVAILABLE |
| Unclaimed | S4 | collect and independently review installed controller evidence | — | AVAILABLE |

## Worker update procedure

Each worker follows this process for every increment:

1. Pull/fetch current repository state and read this document, `CONTRACT.md`,
   and `MODEL_COMMAND_RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
2. Confirm the selected stage and the other lane's latest evidence.
3. Add or update one active work claim. Do not claim broad directories when a
   narrower path is sufficient.
4. Work on a feature branch or otherwise coordinate before editing shared files.
5. Make one bounded change. Do not mix model training, schema migration,
   controller behavior, and physical testing in one unreviewable increment.
6. Run lane tests plus the shared boundary suite affected by the change.
7. Append an evidence row. Update only the worker's owned lane status.
8. If both lanes are ready, run the shared integration gate using actual producer
   output—not a hand-authored substitute—and append an `INT` evidence row.
9. Review diff, run the repository audit, commit, and push or open a pull request
   according to the repository contribution process.
10. Leave failed evidence visible and name the precise next dependency.

## Merge and conflict rules

- AI workers primarily own `software/ai/rocell_ai`, training/evaluation assets,
  AI tests, and the AI-lane portions of this plan.
- Arm workers primarily own `software/src/rocell`, arm/runtime tests, controller
  adapters, and the arm-lane portions of this plan.
- Shared schemas, shared model types, this stage board, and integration tests
  require cross-lane review.
- Do not silently change a field's meaning while retaining its schema version.
- Do not loosen a consumer because a producer emitted invalid data; correct the
  producer or perform a documented schema migration.
- Resolve concurrent ledger edits by retaining both evidence rows in chronological
  order. Never discard another worker's evidence to resolve a Git conflict.

## Immediate coordinated work order

1. **Joint S1 design:** agree on v2 freshness, uncertainty, capability, and
   motion-hint semantics before coding either decoder or emitter.
2. **AI S1 producer:** implement the v2 emitter and adversarial producer tests.
3. **Arm S1 consumer:** implement strict v2 decoding, independent registry and
   freshness checks, and v1 migration fixtures.
4. **Integration S1:** round-trip actual v2 producer bytes and mutation-test every
   identity and freshness field.
5. **Joint S2 runner:** compose raw text through the actual emitter and arm
   coordinator into a single zero-hardware trace.
6. Continue measured S3 work independently, but do not install a qualification
   or promote the planner until its own held-out and commissioning gates pass.
7. Begin S4 zero-write encoding only from sealed envelopes; do not couple it to
   model internals or add controller fields to the batch.

## Definition of shared completion

The shared program is not complete merely because the model predicts plausible
coordinates or the arm follows manually supplied commands. Completion requires:

- supported user text produces the intended deterministic plan;
- fresh qualified perception produces a correctly bounded named target;
- the exact batch survives strict arm admission;
- measured planning produces a smooth collision-screened trajectory;
- one controlled writer executes it without ambiguous retry;
- independent evidence confirms the intended device effect; and
- held-out missions meet declared correctness, recovery, and latency thresholds.

Until then, every artifact remains a scoped research, simulation, shadow,
commissioning, or bounded physical result with its limitations intact.


### E-20260926-AI-003 — S1 AI semantic proposal and unchanged boundary regression

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `a0c2715429d7d2ebbe83f2866eef1b8abdfe6ae1` (exact tested runtime/fixture source baseline; proposal and evidence are added together in this ledger entry's containing commit)
- Change: proposed v2 freshness/lease, separate confidence and uncertainty,
  independent placement/oriented target regions, target-map and capability binding,
  and removal of motion hints. No schema, emitter or consumer change.
- Inputs/fixtures: five test modules and proposal SHA-256 identities in
  `software/ai/eval/s1_ai_design_v0.json`; existing synthetic fixture factories.
- Command: `python -m pytest -q software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_journal.py software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope.py`
- Result: PASS, 29 existing boundary regression tests; v2 implementation and joint
  agreement remain pending. This result does not validate the proposed v2 semantics.
- Artifacts: [AI proposal](CONTRACT_V2_AI_PROPOSAL.md),
  [evidence manifest](../eval/s1_ai_design_v0.json)
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: document-only semantic increment; no qualified localization,
  measured placement, v2 schema/decoder/emitter or integration gate evidence.
  Current synthetic margin failures remain preserved in AI-002.
- Supersedes: none
- Next dependency: arm-lane review of clock/lease ownership, independent placement
  record, oriented target-map representation, uncertainty composition, confidence
  source, capability registry and removal of hints; then jointly publish v2 schema.

### E-20260926-AI-005 — analytic oriented-target acceptance cases

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `72f12ffaa16aaf0bea002f335af8260afc432bb0` (evaluation-helper source baseline; new fixtures/tests and evidence committed together in this entry's containing commit)
- Change: added 10 analytic cases for independent target geometry, exact edge,
  uncertainty crossing, rotation, displaced targets and self-centering failure.
- Inputs/fixtures: `software/ai/eval/s1_geometry_cases_v0.json`; exact file hashes
  in `software/ai/eval/s1_geometry_evidence_v0.json`.
- Command: `python -m pytest -q software/ai/tests/test_s1_geometry_cases.py software/ai/tests/test_prediction_margin.py`
- Result: PASS, 7 tests including 10 analytic vectors. Rotated enclosing AABB
  accepts a point the true key region rejects; self-centering hides displacement.

- Limitations: evaluation-only geometry; fixtures are not independent runtime
  evidence. No schema/emitter/decoder change, qualification or integration completion.
  These tests cannot establish provenance independence; that requires a registry.
- Supersedes: none

  new geometry fixture/test files hashed in AI-005 evidence manifest.
- Command: `python scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`

### E-20260926-ARM-001 — strict v2 arm contract and admission boundary

- Stage: S1
- Lane: Arm/runtime
- Commit: `c579746dd801987fa66445fecbc1f5ebd8fe99b1`
- Change: accepted the AI lane's core S1 semantics and implemented the published
  v2 batch/proposal schemas, strict duplicate-free decoder, explicit board-plane
  geometry profile, epoch-ms freshness and external lease checks, monotonic
  post-admission deadline, independently supplied capability/evidence/qualification
  bindings, ordered action indexes, oriented convex target regions, additive
  localization-plus-placement bounds, and separate surface-normal qualification.
  Speed and clearance are absent. The output remains zero-authority.
- Inputs/fixtures: existing v1 fixtures; analytic S1 geometry vectors; v2 H/I
  keyboard fixtures with independently supplied region, placement, model, camera,
  clock, lease, map, board-frame, capability and qualification identities.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/ai/tests/test_s1_geometry_cases.py software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_journal.py software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 48 tests. Both JSON schemas also passed Draft 2020-12 schema
  self-validation. V1 and v2 decoders explicitly reject the other's wire format.

- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: arm fixtures are handcrafted consumer tests, not actual AI emitter
  bytes; no localization qualification is installed; trusted registry records are
  injected by the caller and still require production registry plumbing. Admission
  generates no trajectory or controller command and grants no execution authority.
- Supersedes: arm-side semantic-review dependency in AI-003; it does not supersede
  the AI producer or shared integration gates.
- Next dependency: AI lane emits canonical v2 bytes matching these frozen field
  meanings, then the shared S1 integration gate mutation-tests those actual bytes.


### E-20260926-ARM-002 — v2 increment audit retains existing findings

- Stage: S1

- Command: `python scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`
- Result: FAIL, exit 1; 5,593 paths, 903.2 MiB, the same 14 existing

  of the S1 producer/consumer integration work.


### E-20260926-ARM-003 — monotonic pre-planner lease and registry recheck

- Stage: S1
- Lane: Arm/runtime
- Commit: `f0074b1d4d63e7acdbfeb7bd7c1c017a7179e2b5`
- Change: added a second fail-closed gate immediately before deterministic
  planning. It verifies the original ingress hash and zero-authority fields,
  rejects equality at the monotonic deadline, and rechecks the active capability,
  external scene lease, independent placement, and target-map hashes so revocation
  after ingress cannot silently enter planning.
- Inputs/fixtures: accepted v2 H/I ingress report, exact-deadline case, changed
  placement registry identity, and tampered ingress content.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 28 tests.
- Artifacts: `software/src/rocell/application/model_motion_ingress_v2.py` and
  `software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: this recheck does not plan, encode, or execute movement; active
  registry identities are still supplied by the caller until persistent trusted
  registry plumbing is implemented.
- Supersedes: none; extends ARM-001.
- Next dependency: actual AI-emitted v2 bytes and production trusted-registry
  adapters for the shared S1 integration gate.


### E-20260926-ARM-004 — AI build review and coherent trusted registry snapshot

- Stage: S1
- Lane: Arm/runtime
- Commit: `10c74587e96b22c69527fc0b95df1154b7f2028f`
- Decision review: retain the split architecture. The parser/model/vision lane may
  propose intent and board-frame target coordinates; deterministic arm code owns
  trust resolution, freshness, uncertainty composition, planning, policy and all
  physical authority. The current actual AI emitter remains v1: it still carries
  speed/clearance, copies qualification coverage into confidence, uses nominal
  axis-aligned target rectangles, and emits none of the v2 camera, clock, lease,
  independent placement or uncertainty identities. It therefore must not be
  connected to the v2 planner path until the AI lane performs an explicit emitter
  migration and shared actual-byte integration gate.
- Change: added an immutable consumer-owned `TrustedMotionRegistryV2` snapshot and
  wrapper functions for ingress and pre-planner revalidation. The snapshot requires
  one coherent capability, camera/clock, external lease, evidence set, independent
  placement/frame/map, localization qualification, policy thresholds and exact
  oriented-region coverage. The model cannot populate or expand these records.
- Inputs/fixtures: v2 H/I model batch; coherent registry; incomplete target scope;
  region from a different placement; immutable region-map attempt.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress.py software/ai/tests/test_s1_geometry_cases.py software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 35 tests.
- Artifacts: `software/src/rocell/application/model_motion_registry_v2.py` and
  `software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: the snapshot is an in-process trusted adapter, not persistent signed
  registry storage; no installed localization qualification or actual v2 producer
  output exists. The v1 emitter remains available only for frozen offline research.
- Supersedes: the registry-plumbing limitation in ARM-001 and ARM-003 at the
  in-process boundary; it does not complete the AI emitter or shared integration.
- Next dependency: AI lane implements an explicit v2 emitter using the frozen
  schemas and produces canonical bytes plus one-field mutation fixtures. Then run
  the S1 producer-to-registry-to-arm integration gate without auto-upgrading v1.

### E-20260926-AI-007 — v2 typed producer assembly and consumer regression

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `413cb8796d7b470752d839b19763f8c903c771c7` (shared consumer/source baseline; new assembly, tests and evidence committed together in this entry's containing commit)
- Change: reviewed ARM-001/003 and adopted published shared types; implemented
  canonical v2 assembly with ordered repeated actions and missing-uncertainty
  abstention. No direct hardware or lower-level command fields added.
- Inputs/fixtures: arm v2 synthetic H/I fixture factories, compiler-shaped H,H,I
  plan; hashes in `software/ai/eval/s1_v2_assembly_evidence.json`.
- Command: `python -m pytest -q software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter_v2.py software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_journal.py software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope.py`
- Result: PASS, 55 tests; actual assembler bytes decode and enter fixture-based
  consumer admission; repeated H,H,I preserved; confidence 0.93 remains distinct
  from coverage 0.99; missing evidence, wrong profile, uncovered/missing target,
  invalid confidence, same precision/placement hash and expiry reject or abstain.
- Artifacts: `software/ai/rocell_ai/batch_emitter_v2.py`,
  `software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter_v2.py`, evidence manifest above.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: assembly consumes caller-supplied typed evidence. It cannot attest
  that coordinates derive from referenced precision evidence, establish trusted
  placement provenance, or validate qualification registries. Current perception
  has no qualified v2 adapter. No qualification installed; no integration completion.
- Supersedes: none
- Next dependency: AI precision adapter binds observed coordinates/confidence to
  exact evidence; persistent trusted registry adapters and full mutation matrix
  remain needed before cross-lane S1 completion.


### E-20260926-AI-008 — v2 assembly audit retains findings

- Commits: `20b669c8914ba83cd4bdddc98abae128af1342a2` and
  `f032dc85b3dda58396865e5ca32c54857a4b5570`
- Change: passed canonical bytes from the actual AI v2 assembler through Draft
  2020-12 schema validation, the strict shared decoder, the consumer-owned trusted
  registry, arm ingress, and the monotonic pre-planner recheck. Closed a review
  gap by binding the registry and ingress to exact capture ID, frame ID and image
  hash in addition to camera, clock, derived evidence, lease and geometry records.
- Inputs/fixtures: repeated H,H,I plan; actual canonical assembler bytes; coherent
  synthetic registry fixture; one-field mutations for plan, image, frame, future
  time, capability, camera, clock, lease, placement, target map, qualification,
  domain, uncertainty and safe-region edge; exact expiry.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/tests/integration/test_model_motion_v2_shared_gate.py software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter_v2.py software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_journal.py software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 73 tests. The shared S1 producer/consumer contract integration
  gate is complete; all tested mutations fail closed before planning.
- Artifacts: `software/tests/integration/test_model_motion_v2_shared_gate.py`,
  `software/ai/rocell_ai/batch_emitter_v2.py`, and the v2 registry/ingress modules.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: all evidence and geometry remain synthetic/caller-supplied. This
  proves contract compatibility and rejection behavior, not perception correctness,
  installed qualification, physical planning readiness or execution authority.
- Supersedes: the actual-producer integration dependency in ARM-001/004 and AI-007;
  it does not supersede AI-007's missing precision-evidence adapter dependency.
- Next dependency: AI lane binds precision outputs to exact capture/evidence and
  reaches its own S1 acceptance criteria; S2 then composes the full zero-hardware
  text-to-envelope path using these exact bytes and trusted arm gates.

### E-20260926-ARM-006 — v2 proposals enter arm-owned measured planning policy

- Stage: S2
- Lane: Arm/runtime
- Commit: `dfce88e823f9540db03650392dbbb169e366a336`
- Change: added a fail-closed adapter from an admitted v2 proposal and fresh
  pre-planner lease into the existing measured planner. The adapter verifies the
  ingress and pre-planner hashes, exact batch/action lineage, monotonic deadline,
  and zero-authority fields. It derives clearance and speed exclusively from an
  arm-owned policy, preserves the original v2 evidence hashes, and refuses to
  encode or authorize controller commands.
- Inputs/fixtures: coherent H/I v2 batch, consumer-owned trusted registry,
  admitted ingress report, fresh pre-planner report, conservative arm policy,
  tampered ingress, exact expiry, altered action identity, and an upstream report
  that falsely claims hardware access.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_planner_gate.py software/tests/integration/test_model_motion_v2_shared_gate.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 48 tests. The valid input reaches the real measured planner and
  terminates as `BLOCKED_CALIBRATION_MISSING_OR_STALE`; IK and route screening do
  not run, and no envelope or controller command is fabricated. Tamper, expiry,
  wrong-action, and upstream-authority cases fail closed.
- Artifacts: `software/src/rocell/application/model_motion_planner_gate_v2.py`,
  `software/src/rocell/application/__init__.py`, and
  `software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: the internal v1 proposal is only a deterministic compatibility
  surrogate for the existing measured planner; it is not a wire migration and
  never replaces the original v2 lineage. No measured deployment calibration or
  localization qualification is installed, so no trajectory envelope is
  produced. The complete raw-text-to-envelope trace runner and v2 sequence
  coordinator remain unfinished.
- Supersedes: none; extends the S1 admission chain into S2 measured planning.
- Next dependency: compose the actual AI v2 bytes, this policy adapter, fresh
  observed-state fixtures, and ordered coordination into one zero-hardware trace;
  separately, the AI lane must bind precision output to exact evidence.

### E-20260926-ARM-008 — actual v2 bytes produce a zero-hardware shadow trace

- Stage: S2
- Lane: Arm/runtime
- Commit: `f4f045afc2cce46ecfe0d7c4ed585a6268c3175e`
- Change: added one deterministic shadow boundary that strictly decodes actual AI
  v2 bytes, admits them through the consumer-owned registry, rechecks the
  monotonic lease, binds a fresh observed-state fixture and arm-owned motion
  policy, evaluates actions in order, and stops at the first exact planner
  blocker. The trace links request, plan, payload, batch, observation, ingress,
  pre-planner, observed-state, policy and per-action planner hashes.
- Inputs/fixtures: actual H,H,I bytes from `batch_emitter_v2`, coherent synthetic
  trusted registry, fresh zero-authority observed-state fixture, conservative arm
  policy, and one stale observed-state mutation.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/tests/integration/test_model_motion_v2_shared_gate.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_planner_gate.py software/ai/tests/test_precision_binding_v2.py software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter_v2.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 65 tests. The trace evaluates action 0 and terminates at
  `BLOCKED_CALIBRATION_MISSING_OR_STALE`; it emits no envelope, controller
  command or Waveshare byte. A stale observed state is rejected before planning.
- Artifacts: `software/src/rocell/application/model_motion_shadow_v2.py`,

- Limitations: this is the first actual-byte S2 trace, not S2 completion. Missing
  measured calibrations prevent reprojection, IK and collision screening, so the
  trace cannot yet seal an execution envelope. It stops on action 0 and does not
  yet adapt the existing sequence coordinator to v2 or demonstrate ambiguous,
  obstructed and unsupported raw-request terminal cases in one command.
- Supersedes: none; extends ARM-006 from one planner call to a hash-linked actual
  producer-byte trace.
- Next dependency: add v2 ordered coordination and an envelope-ready measured or
  explicitly synthetic qualification fixture, then compose raw parser outcomes
  and the full cross-lane negative matrix without weakening the physical gate.

### E-20260926-ARM-010 — ordered v2 coordinator blocks unsafe envelope migration

- Stage: S2
- Lane: Arm/runtime
- Commit: `9c4acf3ede92e4394e942e138a82c5a95062d2fc`
- Change: added an ordered v2 sequence coordinator and routed the actual-byte
  shadow trace through it. The coordinator verifies ingress, pre-planner and
  planner report hashes; preserves repeated ordered proposals; consumes one
  fresh observed state only for the current action; forbids lookahead, automatic
  retry and authority; and remains on action 0 when the measured planner blocks.
  It also records a newly explicit contract boundary: the existing v1 trajectory
  envelope binds the measured-planner surrogate proposal, not the original v2
  proposal, so automatic envelope migration is forbidden.
- Inputs/fixtures: actual AI H,H,I v2 bytes, coherent trusted registry, fresh
  observed-state fixture, arm-owned conservative policy, missing measured
  calibration blocker, and a repeated evaluation attempt after the blocker.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/tests/integration/test_model_motion_v2_shared_gate.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_planner_gate.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py software/ai/tests/test_precision_binding_v2.py software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter_v2.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 71 tests. The coordinator snapshot retains all three ordered
  proposal hashes but plans only action 0, enters `BLOCKED`, rejects a second
  evaluation, generates no envelope or wire bytes, and grants no authority.
- Artifacts:
  `software/src/rocell/application/model_motion_sequence_coordinator_v2.py`,
  `software/src/rocell/application/model_motion_shadow_v2.py`,
  `software/src/rocell/application/__init__.py`, and
  `software/tests/integration/test_model_motion_v2_shared_gate.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: no action can advance because measured calibration is absent. A
  future v2 envelope must bind both the original v2 proposal/planner wrapper and
  the internal measured-planner trajectory lineage. This increment intentionally
  does not reinterpret the v1 envelope or fabricate an envelope-ready fixture.
- Supersedes: none; extends ARM-008 with an explicit ordered lifecycle.
- Next dependency: define and test a dual-lineage v2 trajectory-envelope wrapper,
  then produce it only from a fully screened measured planner result.

### E-20260926-ARM-012 — dual-lineage v2 trajectory-envelope contract

- Stage: S2
- Lane: Arm/runtime
- Commit: `af57bee3672d65a3063ce69527784a96213a6c43`
- Change: added a zero-authority v2 trajectory-envelope wrapper that preserves
  both the original v2 proposal/planner lineage and the internal measured-planner
  surrogate lineage. Binding requires explicit readiness at both planner layers,
  exact batch/action hashes and an already validated controller-independent v1
  measured trajectory. A blocked planner report cannot be wrapped. The S2 arm
  lane is now `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION` on its exact-blocker path.
- Inputs/fixtures: actual v2 H/I model and planner objects, real missing-calibration
  blocker, an explicitly synthetic dual-ready planner report used only to test
  the contract, a validated controller-independent trajectory envelope, crossed
  surrogate identity and tampered planner report.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope.py software/tests/integration/test_model_motion_v2_shared_gate.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_planner_gate.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py software/ai/tests/test_capture_binding.py software/ai/tests/test_precision_binding_v2.py software/ai/tests/test_batch_emitter_v2.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 91 tests. Blocked reports fail closed; the synthetic readiness
  fixture seals both lineages; crossed surrogate and tampered report identities
  reject; all envelope documents remain free of wire commands and authority.
- Artifacts:
  `software/src/rocell/application/trajectory_execution_envelope_v2.py`,
  `software/src/rocell/application/__init__.py`, and
  `software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope_v2.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: readiness is a contract-only synthetic fixture, not evidence that
  current measured planning passes. The real shadow trace still terminates at
  missing/stale calibration before reprojection or IK. The wrapper is not a
  dispatch permit and cannot be encoded by a writable adapter.
- Supersedes: the dual-lineage envelope dependency recorded by ARM-010; it does
  not supersede the missing-calibration blocker.
- Next dependency: shared integration composes raw parser outcomes, actual
  perception/assembler bytes and the arm shadow runner into one command with the
  supported, ambiguous, stale, obstructed, out-of-bound and unsupported matrix.

### E-20260926-INT-003 — raw request reaches the actual v2 arm shadow path

- Stage: S2
- Lane: INTEGRATION
- Commit: `ffa5cf82fdf6be33e35e349ac1e171486ce186f5`
- Change: added a zero-authority shared runner from raw text through the grounded
  parser, deterministic compiler, actual v2 batch assembler, decoder, trusted
  ingress, sequence coordination, and arm shadow planner. The integration found
  and fixed a real producer/consumer discrepancy: the compiler's profile ID
  `development/keyboard-us-lowercase-semantic-v1` contains `/`, while the v2
  schema and arm runtime previously accepted only generic identifiers. Profile
  IDs now use a dedicated bounded rule; generic identifiers remain unchanged.
- Inputs/fixtures: explicit `SYNTHETIC_INTEGRATION_ONLY` typed observation,
  evidence, registry, and fresh observed-state fixtures from the existing v2
  shared gate; raw requests and terminal cases in
  `software/tests/integration/test_shared_shadow_runner_v2.py`.

- Result: PASS, 95 tests. Supported `type hhi on keyboard` preserves three
  ordered actions and reaches the exact current arm blocker
  `BLOCKED_CALIBRATION_MISSING_OR_STALE`. Ambiguous, unsupported, stale,
  obstructed, missing-perception, out-of-bounds, and expired-evidence cases stop
  at their expected terminal states. The exact compiler profile validates under
  both the published JSON schema and runtime decoder.

- Limitations: this is partial S2 integration, not S2 completion. The accepted
  supported path uses an explicitly labeled synthetic integration fixture. The
  selected precision/confidence workstream has not emitted qualified deployment
  evidence, and AI-017 correctly records complete abstention under its failed
  research criteria. No envelope is produced because measured calibration is
  still missing or stale.
- Supersedes: none; extends INT-001 and INT-002 without changing their evidence.
- Next dependency: connect authenticated capture plus a qualified, independently
  bounded precision observation to this runner; then repeat the terminal matrix
  with actual producer evidence and measured calibration.

- Limitations: same pretrained weights originated at 128x96, so this is an
  equal-budget adaptation comparison, not from-scratch proof that higher resolution
  cannot help. One training seed; development selects epoch and reports quality;
  no independent generalization or physical claim, new evaluation data or qualification.
- Supersedes: none; extends inference-only AI-023 without rewriting it.
- Next dependency: use 128x96 as the development reference; investigate target-local
  geometric refinement and confidence on development groups before a new frozen
  held-out run. Keep failed confidence results and runtime abstention unchanged.

### E-20260926-ARM-014 — sealed-envelope T102 zero-write preview

- Stage: S4
- Lane: ARM
- Commit: `575669b206fc671bb51277971843a9cf690082e4`
- Change: implemented a transport-free Waveshare T=102 preview adapter that
  accepts only a sealed dual-lineage v2 trajectory envelope, an exact encoding
  profile, and a separately issued single-use evidence-only permit. The observed
  starting waypoint is retained as state and never encoded as a movement. Every
  later waypoint maps the five planner joints to base/shoulder/elbow/wrist/roll,
  holds the gripper at one explicit fixed angle, and retains its host dispatch
  time separately from the firmware's opaque `spd` and `acc` fields.
- Inputs/fixtures: synthetic ready v2 envelope fixture from
  `software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope_v2.py`; encoding
  profile bound to exact vendor-source, joint-map, controller-session,
  configuration-epoch, and trajectory-limit hashes.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/ai/tests software/tests/unit/test_zero_write_waveshare_adapter_v1.py software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_all_joint_command.py software/tests/unit/test_arm_protocol.py software/tests/integration/test_shared_shadow_runner_v2.py software/tests/integration/test_model_motion_v2_shared_gate.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_planner_gate.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 261 tests after merging the concurrent AI work. Golden bytes are
  deterministic. Reused permits, duplicate correlations, stale permits, altered
  envelopes, mismatched controller sessions/configuration epochs/limit profiles,
  unsupported interpolation or gripper behavior, invalid firmware settings, and
  schedules exceeding the envelope deadline fail closed without retry.
- Artifacts: `software/src/rocell/application/zero_write_waveshare_adapter_v1.py`,
  its application exports, and
  `software/tests/unit/test_zero_write_waveshare_adapter_v1.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: this is an encoding preview and receipt, not a sole writable
  transport owner or physical execution permit. It opens no transport, submits
  no bytes, receives no acknowledgement or feedback, and does not prove that
  the configured vendor artifact, mapping, rate settings, or joint limits match
  the installed controller. The ready trajectory used by the test is synthetic.
- Supersedes: none; starts the arm-owned S4 implementation.
- Next dependency: place this exact encoder behind one separately reviewed sole
  writer, define partial-write/timeout/restart closure, and qualify the installed
  firmware mapping before any physical authority is possible.

### E-20260926-ARM-015 — S4 preview audit findings retained

- Stage: S4

- Inputs/fixtures: repository snapshot and `scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`.
- Command: `python scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`
- Result: FAIL, exit 1; 5,653 paths, 903.4 MiB, the same 14 existing

- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: heuristic findings remain unresolved; this is not a clean
  repository security-audit claim.
- Supersedes: none; preserves every previous audit failure.
- Next dependency: fixture-owner review remains independent of S4 writer and
  installed-controller qualification.

### E-20260926-ARM-016 — zero-write sole-writer lifecycle and restart closure

- Stage: S4
- Lane: ARM
- Commit: `8ddd984d4dd8df1f18e58c2f743854642b84abe7`
- Change: wrapped the hash-bound T=102 preview receipt in a transport-free
  single-owner lifecycle. One correlation can be reserved once. Events are
  ordinal, hash-chained, bound to the exact preview receipt and writer instance,
  and exported as strict canonical journal bytes. Normal rehearsal closes
  terminally; injected partial write, acknowledgement timeout, feedback timeout,
  and uncertain close all close as `AMBIGUOUS_NO_RETRY`. A process restart after
  reservation reconstructs only as `RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED_NO_RETRY` and cannot
  automatically replay.
- Inputs/fixtures: ARM-014 zero-write preview receipt and its sealed synthetic v2
  trajectory fixture; analytic counterfactual fault labels only.
- Command: `python -m pytest software/ai/tests software/tests/unit/test_zero_write_sole_writer_v1.py software/tests/unit/test_zero_write_waveshare_adapter_v1.py software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_all_joint_command.py software/tests/unit/test_arm_protocol.py software/tests/integration/test_shared_shadow_runner_v2.py software/tests/integration/test_model_motion_v2_shared_gate.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_planner_gate.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py -q`
- Result: PASS, 272 tests. Concurrent claim attempts permit exactly one owner;
  consumed/closed/recovered journals refuse replay. Altered event content,
  duplicate JSON fields, wrong receipt identity, and unknown fault modes reject.
  Every success and failure report records zero transport opens, zero physical
  writes, no submitted bytes, and no automatic retry.
- Artifacts: `software/src/rocell/application/zero_write_sole_writer_v1.py`,
  its application exports, and
  `software/tests/unit/test_zero_write_sole_writer_v1.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: fault labels are counterfactual lifecycle injections; no serial or
  HTTP transport is imported, opened, or exercised. Restart safety depends on
  retaining and reconstructing the exact journal bytes; a production durable
  reservation store is not implemented. No installed controller mapping,
  firmware-version match, acknowledgement grammar, or feedback qualification is
  claimed.
- Supersedes: none; extends ARM-014 without granting physical authority.
- Next dependency: publish strict permit/receipt schemas and a committed golden
  byte fixture, then bind them to independently commissioned controller mapping
  and firmware evidence before considering the S4 arm lane ready.

### E-20260926-AI-042 — candidate uncertainty and full-region study

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `de696d1abff38f1db40a01daed8fd4235c350517` (exact frozen source/manifest before scoring)
- Change: calibrated 99% nearest-rank radius from seed-group maximum errors;
  independently evaluated error coverage and full-disk containment around actual
  predictions in hidden-truth oriented key regions. No automatic qualification.
- Inputs/fixtures: 1,000 fresh 19M calibration groups and 500 fresh 20M evaluation
  groups, 3 conditions/46 targets. Candidate/source/catalog hashes in
  `eval/candidate_uncertainty_v0.manifest.json`; group hashes/scores in scorecard.
- Command: `python software/ai/vision/evaluate_candidate_uncertainty.py`
- Result: FAIL, `SYNTHETIC_COMBINED_CRITERIA_FAIL`. Radius 5.201783 mm; error coverage
  494/500 groups (98.8%) passes 95% criterion. Actual complete-region group fit
  380/500 (76%) fails 95% criterion. 64,859/69,000 individual target predictions
  fit; this does not replace the frozen all-target/all-condition group criterion.
- Artifacts: `software/ai/eval/candidate_uncertainty_v0_scorecard.json`, manifest,
  evaluator; full source study retained locally under ignored
  `software/ai/results/candidate_uncertainty_v0_full.json` (content hash in scorecard).
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: empirical coverage, not population guarantee. Hidden truth is
  evaluation-only and cannot become runtime placement calibration. Synthetic
  known targets only; no confidence/capture/physical qualification. 19M/20M seed
  groups are consumed and cannot be reused as fresh independent evaluation.
- Supersedes: none; earlier failures and improvements preserved.
- Next dependency: investigate residual-tail causes using development groups;
  any target-specific or conditional uncertainty method needs separate frozen
  calibration/evaluation and must preserve complete-region checking. No promotion.

### E-20260926-AI-043 — uncertainty evidence verification

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `de696d1abff38f1db40a01daed8fd4235c350517` (study baseline; test and evidence committed together)
- Change: recomputed calibration quantile, evaluation coverage, region-fit counts,
  frozen source identities and failure outcome.
- Inputs/fixtures: frozen manifest/scorecard and `tests/test_candidate_uncertainty_evidence.py`.
- Command: `python -m pytest -q software/ai/tests/test_candidate_uncertainty_evidence.py`
- Result: PASS, 1 evidence test; study failure remains unchanged.

- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: consistency only; no qualification or integration status change.
- Supersedes: none
- Next dependency: AI-042 development-tail investigation.

### E-20260926-AI-046 — development residual-tail stratification

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `ee9ab18fdefb69aab4213318e902d24974322b67` (exact frozen diagnostic and manifest)
- Change: analyzed candidate residuals on existing development images using a
  predeclared >3mm maximum-key-error diagnostic and marginal scene/pose bins.
- Inputs/fixtures: 200 existing 15M development groups, 600 images, 46 targets;
  checkpoint/source hashes in `eval/development_tails_v0.manifest.json`; image
  hash, per-image, per-key and stratified metrics in scorecard.
- Command: `python software/ai/vision/diagnose_development_tails.py`
- Result: PASS for descriptive diagnostic. 22/600 images exceed 3mm: standard
  5/200 (2.5%), appearance_shift 7/200 (3.5%), challenge 10/200 (5%). All four
  position bins and all three orientation bins contain large-error cases.
  Mean maximum-key error 1.215390 mm; mean center error 0.856611 mm.
- Artifacts: `software/ai/eval/development_tails_v0_scorecard.json`, manifest,
  `software/ai/vision/diagnose_development_tails.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: marginal strata are correlated/confounded, not causal or statistically
  significant effects. Truth-derived pose bins are scoring metadata, not runtime
  rules. No per-image occlusion labels; cannot isolate lighting/obstruction causes.
  No new calibration/evaluation data consumed; no qualification or runtime changes.
- Supersedes: none
- Next dependency: freeze a paired single-perturbation development study to isolate
  added brightness, blur and obstruction effects before targeted retraining;
  preserve all consumed calibration/evaluation splits.

### E-20260926-AI-047 — development-tail evidence checks

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `ee9ab18fdefb69aab4213318e902d24974322b67` (diagnostic baseline; new test committed with evidence)
- Change: verified frozen hashes, exact development-only seed set, fixed tail
  threshold and stratified counts.
- Inputs/fixtures: frozen manifest/scorecard and `tests/test_development_tails.py`.
- Command: `python -m pytest -q software/ai/tests/test_development_tails.py`
- Result: PASS, 1 evidence test.
- Artifacts: named test, manifest and scorecard.
- Hardware writes: 0

### E-20260926-AI-048 — tail diagnostic repository audit

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `ee9ab18fdefb69aab4213318e902d24974322b67` (diagnostic baseline plus scorecard/test)
- Change: required read-only audit after diagnostic.
- Inputs/fixtures: repository snapshot and reviewed fixture manifest.
- Command: `python scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`
- Result: PASS, exit 0; 5,678 paths, 786.3 MiB; 0 unresolved findings and 14 reviewed synthetic fixtures.
- Artifacts: auditor, fixture review manifest and AI-046 artifacts.
- Hardware writes: 0

### E-20260926-AI-049 — paired single-perturbation development study

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `a8f2a0982939877473c11bfa61167e921ea20479` (exact frozen diagnostic/manifest before scoring)
- Change: added brightness factor 0.5, Gaussian blur 1.2 pixels, or fixed small
  opaque rectangle separately to the same standard development image per seed.
- Inputs/fixtures: existing 15M 200 development groups; 4 variants/seed, 46 targets;
  checkpoint/source hashes in `eval/single_perturbations_v0.manifest.json`;
  per-condition pixel hashes, paired cases and counts in scorecard.
- Command: `python software/ai/vision/diagnose_single_perturbations.py`
- Result: PASS for completed diagnostic. Mean key error base 0.853172 mm,
  darkened 2.515475 mm, blur 0.832448 mm, obstruction 0.871324 mm. Images with
  maximum key error >3mm: 5, 87, 4, 5 respectively (200 each). Darkening worsens
  178/200 images and introduces 83 new >3mm cases. Added effects are paired.
- Artifacts: `software/ai/eval/single_perturbations_v0_scorecard.json`, manifest,
  `software/ai/vision/diagnose_single_perturbations.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: base renderer already contains nuisance effects; fixed synthetic
  strengths/obstruction location do not represent all camera/arm conditions.
  No interactions, visibility qualification, measured lighting threshold or
  held-out data. Small mean changes do not establish blur/obstruction safety.
- Supersedes: none
- Next dependency: freeze paired brightness-augmentation training versus control
  on development groups, retaining baseline/yaw checks; later use fresh calibration
  and evaluation. Do not infer a deployable darkness threshold from this study.

### E-20260926-AI-050 — paired perturbation evidence tests

- Change: verified base-image immutability, brightness arithmetic, unknown-condition
  rejection, source hashes, development seeds and paired metric counts.
- Inputs/fixtures: analytic PIL image and frozen paired scorecard/manifest.
- Command: `python -m pytest -q software/ai/tests/test_single_perturbations.py`
- Result: PASS, 2 tests.
- Artifacts: named test and AI-049 scorecard.
- Hardware writes: 0

### E-20260926-AI-051 — paired perturbation publication audit

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `a8f2a0982939877473c11bfa61167e921ea20479` (frozen diagnostic baseline; scorecard and tests committed with evidence)
- Change: audited the publication snapshot after adding paired perturbation evidence.
- Inputs/fixtures: repository snapshot including AI-049 scorecard and AI-050 tests;
  existing reviewed synthetic fixture allowlist.
- Command: `python scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`
- Result: PASS; 5682 paths, 786.5 MiB, 0 unresolved findings,
  14 reviewed synthetic fixtures.
- Artifacts: repository snapshot and audit stdout.
- Hardware writes: 0

- Limitations: heuristic snapshot audit only; no physical or localization
  qualification. Protected-main publication blocker AI-041 remains.
- Supersedes: none; historical failed audit evidence remains unchanged.

  authorized PR creation and protected-branch checks for main publication.

### E-20260926-ARM-018 — published zero-write controller boundary

- Stage: S4
- Lane: ARM
- Commit: `b858420` (implementation commit; evidence row committed separately)
- Change: published strict Draft 2020-12 schemas for the Waveshare T=102
  encoding profile, single-use preview permit, zero-write preview receipt,
  hash-chained sole-writer journal, and lifecycle report. Added stable
  serializations for profile and permit plus a committed exact-byte T=102
  fixture generated through the existing sealed-envelope path.
- Inputs/fixtures: synthetic ready v2 envelope from the established arm test
  factory; `software/tests/fixtures/zero_write_waveshare_v1/t102_waypoint_1.jsonl`;
  fixed offline profile and monotonic timestamps.
- Command: `$env:PYTHONPATH='software/src;software/ai/src;software/tests/unit'; python -m pytest -q software/ai/tests software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_journal.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_zero_write_waveshare_adapter_v1.py software/tests/unit/test_zero_write_sole_writer_v1.py software/tests/integration/test_zero_write_waveshare_contract_v1.py`
- Result: PASS, 210 tests. Runtime documents validate against all five closed
  schemas; exact wire bytes and their SHA-256 match the committed fixture;
  content hashes recompute; the journal round-trips; unpublished fields and
  asserted hardware authority reject.
- Artifacts: five `software/ai/schemas/zero_write_*_v1.schema.json` files,
  schema README, golden JSONL fixture, and
  `software/tests/integration/test_zero_write_waveshare_contract_v1.py`.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: all inputs and bytes are synthetic/offline. The profile binds a
  controller-joint-mapping hash but does not prove that mapping, firmware
  version, acknowledgement grammar, feedback behavior, or installed hardware.
  The encoder still owns no transport or physical authority.
- Supersedes: none; extends ARM-014 and ARM-016 with a published interchange
  boundary.
- Next dependency: independently commission the installed controller mapping
  and firmware evidence before any S4 readiness or physical dispatch claim.

### E-20260926-ARM-019 — zero-write schema audit findings retained

- Stage: S4
- Lane: ARM
- Commit: `b858420` (implementation baseline)
- Change: ran the required read-only repository snapshot audit after publishing
  the zero-write schemas and golden byte fixture.
- Inputs/fixtures: repository snapshot and `scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`.
- Command: `python scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`
- Result: FAIL, exit 1; 5,670 paths, 903.5 MiB, the same 14 existing
  credential-literal-review findings in arm unit fixtures; no new schema,
  golden-fixture, adapter-serialization, or integration-test finding.
- Artifacts: scanner and the existing named fixtures in its output.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: heuristic findings remain unresolved; this is not a clean
  repository security-audit claim.
- Supersedes: none; retains all earlier audit failures.
- Next dependency: fixture-owner review remains independent of installed
  controller mapping and firmware qualification.

### E-20260926-ARM-020 — reviewed-fixture integration verification

- Stage: S4
- Lane: ARM
- Commit: `681e3a3` plus merged `origin/main` at `1cb96bd` (verified integration
  baseline; this evidence row committed separately)
- Change: merged the repository's independently reviewed synthetic-fixture
  allowlist and reran the zero-write/shared-contract tests and snapshot audit
  without changing the S4 artifacts or erasing ARM-019's historical result.
- Inputs/fixtures: ARM-018 artifacts, current AI tests, motion-ingress and
  sequence tests, trajectory envelope tests, snapshot-audit tests, and reviewed
  exception records from `scripts/audit_fixture_reviews.json`.
- Commands: the ARM-018 pytest command plus
  `software/tests/unit/test_snapshot_audit.py`; then
  `python scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`.
- Result: PASS, 229 tests in 43.41 seconds. Audit PASS, exit 0; 5,673 paths,
  903.5 MiB, 0 unresolved review findings, 14 reviewed synthetic fixtures.
- Artifacts: ARM-018 schema/fixture/test artifacts plus the independently merged
  audit review records and tests.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: reviewed audit exceptions are exact synthetic test fixtures, not
  production credentials. Passing schemas and golden bytes still do not qualify
  installed controller mapping, firmware, acknowledgements, feedback, or any
  physical execution path.
- Supersedes: ARM-019 only for current audit status; ARM-019 remains the exact
  pre-review snapshot result.
- Next dependency: independently commission the installed controller mapping
  and firmware evidence before any S4 readiness or physical-dispatch claim.

### E-20260926-AI-052 — matched brightness augmentation development failure

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `4801532e942e8f2574d86813665e327d833502ca` (frozen training source and plan before execution)
- Change: paired fine-tuning from the existing translation-weighted checkpoint.
  Candidate adds a brightness-0.5 copy of every training image; control duplicates
  the unchanged image for equal optimizer steps. Both use weights 4:4:1, 12 epochs,
  common unweighted four-condition development-MSE epoch selection.
- Inputs/fixtures: reused 14M training groups (1200 x 3 x 2 = 7200 images),
  reused 15M development groups (200 x 4 = 800 images), 46 targets/image.
  Source/catalog/initial checkpoint hashes in `train/brightness_pair_v0_plan.json`;
  training/development pixel hashes and output checkpoint hashes in scorecard.
- Command: `python software/ai/vision/train_brightness_pair.py`
- Result: FAIL predefined development candidate rule. Darkened-standard mean key
  error improves 2.399967 -> 0.878742 mm; >3mm maximum-key-error images 87 -> 5/200.
  Standard worsens 0.816161 -> 0.989308 mm, tail 3 -> 6;
  appearance-shift worsens 0.796980 -> 1.013772 mm, tail 5 -> 10;
  challenge worsens 1.029145 -> 1.089872 mm, tail 9 -> 14.
  All original conditions also exceed the allowed 10% yaw-p95 regression.
  Aggregate mean improves 1.260563 -> 0.992923 mm but cannot override condition gates.
  Selected epochs control 12, candidate 10. No model promotion.
- Artifacts: `eval/brightness_pair_v0_scorecard.json`, frozen plan/source;
  ignored local `results/brightness_pair_v0_control/` and
  `results/brightness_pair_v0_brightness_augmented/` checkpoint/result directories.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: one training seed; development data reused for study selection;
  fixed synthetic brightness applied after resizing; no fresh evaluation,
  calibrated uncertainty, authentic camera capture or physical evidence.
  Zero contract changes; shared boundary suite not triggered.
- Supersedes: none; AI-049 and all earlier failed evidence remain intact.
- Next dependency: freeze a bounded lower-intensity brightness training comparison
  (reduced dark-sample proportion and lower learning rate) against a matched control,
  retaining the per-condition error, tail and yaw gates. Require fresh calibration
  and evaluation only after development criteria pass; no installed qualification.

### E-20260926-ARM-021 — installed-controller qualification gate

- Stage: S4
- Lane: ARM
- Commit: `f78b2f1` (implementation commit; evidence row committed separately)
- Change: added a fail-closed assessment between the installed controller's
  independently reviewed evidence and the zero-write Waveshare encoding
  profile. The gate binds controller session, configuration epoch, mapping
  hash, protocol-source hash, T=102 command fields, T=1051 feedback fields,
  planner joint order, fixed gripper field, evidence origin, review disposition,
  and monotonic freshness.
- Inputs/fixtures: modeled physical-shaped and synthetic evidence records;
  existing sealed-envelope/profile factory; published strict evidence and
  assessment schemas. No retained physical original was consumed.
- Command: `$env:PYTHONPATH='software/src;software/ai/src;software/tests/unit'; python -m pytest -q software/ai/tests software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_ingress_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_journal.py software/tests/unit/test_model_motion_sequence_coordinator.py software/tests/unit/test_trajectory_execution_envelope_v2.py software/tests/unit/test_zero_write_waveshare_adapter_v1.py software/tests/unit/test_zero_write_sole_writer_v1.py software/tests/unit/test_installed_controller_qualification_v1.py software/tests/integration/test_zero_write_waveshare_contract_v1.py software/tests/unit/test_snapshot_audit.py`
- Result: PASS, 244 tests in 45.74 seconds. Missing, synthetic, stale,
  unreviewed, pre-capture, session/epoch/mapping/protocol mismatched, reordered,
  and wrong-gripper evidence all block. Exact modeled evidence reaches only
  `READY_FOR_ZERO_WRITE_PROFILE_BINDING`; execution and transport authority
  remain false and zero hardware commands are generated.
- Artifacts:
  `software/src/rocell/application/installed_controller_qualification_v1.py`,
  two `installed_controller_qualification_*_v1.schema.json` schemas, exports,
  schema documentation, and the named unit test.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: success cases use modeled physical-shaped records and prove only
  deterministic gate behavior. The module neither collects nor independently
  authenticates evidence. No installed firmware, mapping, startup behavior,
  feedback behavior, controller identity, or physical execution is qualified.
- Supersedes: none; closes the software trust-boundary gap identified by ARM-018.
- Next dependency: collect retained originals under a separately approved,
  bounded physical qualification and obtain independent review before using a
  passing evidence record.

### E-20260926-ARM-022 — controller-gate repository audit

- Stage: S4
- Lane: ARM
- Commit: `f78b2f1` (implementation baseline)
- Change: ran the required read-only repository snapshot audit after adding the

- Limitations: repository scanning and reviewed synthetic fixture exceptions do
  not qualify controller hardware, firmware, mapping, or runtime behavior.
- Supersedes: none.
- Next dependency: collect and independently review exact installed-controller
  evidence; keep physical execution blocked until that is complete.

### E-20260926-ARM-023 — controller-gate release-doc integration

- Stage: S4
- Lane: ARM
- Commit: `592092b` plus merged `origin/main` at `b1bb742` (verified integration

- Change: merged concurrent experimental-release/support documentation and
  reverified the controller gate without altering its trust or authority rules.
- Inputs/fixtures: ARM-021 suite plus the current repository snapshot.
- Commands: ARM-021 pytest command; `python scripts/audit_github_snapshot.py`.

- Supersedes: ARM-022 only for the current integrated snapshot counts.
- Next dependency: separately approved physical evidence collection and
  independent review before zero-write profile binding can pass on real data.

### E-20260926-AI-055 — reduced brightness augmentation development failure

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `0a878a5ed15a8e516a0ef6b586b940286e64244d` (frozen source and plan before training)
- Change: matched comparison at learning rate 0.00005; candidate darkens extra
  image copies for alternating training seed groups (1800/7200 images, 25 percent).
  Control duplicates unchanged images. Both start from the original translation
  candidate, use 12 epochs and weights 4:4:1, and select the epoch using common
  four-condition unweighted development MSE. Previous rejected model is not used.
- Inputs/fixtures: reused 14M training groups (1200 x 3 x 2), 15M development
  groups (200 x 4), 46 targets/image. Exact source, initial-checkpoint and catalog
  hashes in `train/brightness_reduced_v0_plan.json`; pixel and output checkpoint
  hashes and case-level metrics in the scorecard.
- Command: `python software/ai/vision/train_brightness_reduced.py`
- Result: FAIL predefined development candidate rule. Darkened-standard mean

  challenge mean 1.038751 -> 1.056718 mm, tail 8 -> 13.
  All original conditions fail the yaw-p95 allowance; challenge alone passes
  the original-condition mean-error allowance. Aggregate mean 1.312875 ->

  candidate 9. No promotion or installed qualification.

- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: development selection on reused groups; one training seed;
  factor0.5 applied after resize; lower rate and reduced proportion form a
  combined intervention, so their individual effects are not identified.
  No fresh evaluation, physical capture, calibrated uncertainty or boundary
  change. Shared boundary suite not triggered.
- Supersedes: none; AI-052 failure remains intact.
- Next dependency: freeze a bounded comparison adding baseline-preservation
  distillation on original-condition training images against an otherwise matched
  augmentation control, with unchanged development gates. No fresh evaluation
  or confidence calibration until a candidate passes development criteria.

### E-20260926-AI-058 — baseline-preservation distillation development failure

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `cc6b73dea829e33b6e49e065b42d300c47e64415` (frozen training source/plan before execution)
- Change: both arms use identical 25-percent darkened training images, LR0.00005,
  12 epochs, normalized pose weights 4:4:1 and common development-MSE selection.
  Candidate adds weight4 teacher-preservation loss on original images; control
  weight0. Teacher predictions are detached from the initial checkpoint, using
  training images only. The frozen nonaugmented AI-055 control is an additional
  reference; passing against a regressed augmentation control alone is insufficient.
- Inputs/fixtures: reused 14M 1200 training groups, 7200 images (5400 original);
  reused 15M 200 development groups x4 conditions, 46 targets/image.
  Source, catalog, initial checkpoint and reference-scorecard hashes are in
  `train/brightness_preserved_v0_plan.json`; output checkpoint, pixel and teacher
  prediction hashes and case metrics are in the scorecard.
- Command: `python software/ai/vision/train_brightness_preserved.py`
- Result: FAIL predefined combined development rule. Versus matched augmentation
  control, standard mean 0.918388 -> 0.877357 mm, appearance-shift 1.059982 ->
  0.940878 mm, challenge 1.057172 -> 1.043721 mm, darkened-standard 0.910199 ->
  1.011594 mm. >3mm image counts: standard 4 -> 6, appearance 10 -> 10,
  challenge 13 -> 13, darkened 4 -> 12 (200 images/condition).
  Candidate also fails original-condition mean/tail limits against the frozen
  nonaugmented reference. Aggregate mean 0.986436 -> 0.968388 mm cannot override
  failed gates. Selected epochs control9/candidate10. No model promotion.
- Artifacts: `eval/brightness_preserved_v0_scorecard.json`, frozen plan/source;
  ignored local `results/brightness_preserved_v0_augmentation_control/` and
  `results/brightness_preserved_v0_preservation/` checkpoints/results.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: reused development selection, one seed, synthetic factor0.5 after
  resize, teacher may preserve its own errors; GPU numerical reproducibility is
  not bitwise guaranteed. No fresh evaluation or runtime confidence qualification.
  No boundary change; shared boundary suite not triggered.
- Supersedes: none; earlier brightness failures remain intact.
- Next dependency: freeze a development-only photometric-normalization comparison
  on the unchanged initial checkpoint, with unchanged per-condition error/tail/yaw
  limits. This tests a different intervention after three failed training variants;
  it must not become a runtime preprocessing rule without subsequent evidence.

### E-20260926-AI-061 — fixed lighting normalization development failure

- Stage: S1
- Lane: AI
- Commit: `dd2f0f14f26f78afd327b5aa2d8c6764b4c78f2b` (frozen source and manifest before scoring)
- Change: unchanged initial translation checkpoint; compare original pixels against
  global RGB gain220/p95(luminance), denominator>=1, gain clipped[0.5,2.5], rounded
  and clipped to uint8 after resizing. No truth, target location or camera metadata
  participates in preprocessing; no parameters were tuned after scoring.
- Inputs/fixtures: reused 15M 200 development groups x4 conditions, 46 targets.
  Source/checkpoint/catalog hashes in `eval/lighting_normalization_v0.manifest.json`;
  paired cases, gains and input-pixel digests in scorecard.
- Command: `python software/ai/vision/evaluate_lighting_normalization.py`
- Result: FAIL combined development criteria (11/12 checks pass). Darkened-standard
  mean 2.512120 -> 0.845294 mm; >3mm image count86 -> 6/200.

  Appearance-shift tail increase is the failing check. No runtime preprocessing
  installation, checkpoint promotion or localization qualification.
- Artifacts: `eval/lighting_normalization_v0_scorecard.json`, manifest, evaluator.
- Hardware writes: 0
- Physical movements: 0
- Limitations: reused synthetic development groups, fixed camera rendering and
  synthetic darkening; global gain cannot recover occluded or clipped content.
  Model was not trained with this normalization. Passing individual checks is
  not a held-out, physical or calibrated-confidence claim. No contract changes;
  shared boundary suite not triggered.
- Supersedes: none; all failed training variants remain retained.
- Next dependency: diagnose paired appearance-shift threshold crossings from
  existing cases and image evidence before choosing another normalization rule.
  Preserve failure; do not relax tail criteria to pass this candidate.
