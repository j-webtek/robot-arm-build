# Training

Training begins after the offline benchmark and deterministic/unmodified-model
baselines show a measured need. Track pinned configs, model revisions, seed,
data hash, license and output-use check, tokenizer/chat template, and final
scorecard here. Keep adapters, checkpoints, exports, and run logs in ignored
locations.

The first candidate method is response SFT on verified task proposals.
Preference or logit distillation is a later experiment tied to a specific
failure pattern. Existing ADB-agent Axolotl settings are historical examples,
not defaults for RoCell.

The first provenance-pinned small checkpoint is
[`llama32_1b_candidate.json`](llama32_1b_candidate.json). Its official Meta
source revision is cached locally and imported into Ollama at F16. The
project has not fine tuned it. Its v1 strict-schema baseline failed, so a
training experiment has a measured target. The frozen v2 challenge set must
remain outside training and prompt selection.

The first response-SFT LoRA pilot is recorded in
[`sft_v0_result.json`](sft_v0_result.json). It uses 264 synthetic training
examples and 36 validation examples from [`data/`](../data/README.md). The
adapter improved strict v1 exact matches from 0/31 to 14/31 and scored 10/24
on v2. It still proposed executable plans for five wrong v1 cases and one
wrong v2 case, so its promotion status is **blocked**. v2 has been used for
this final pilot evaluation; create a new held-out set before another tuning
round.

Reproduce the local pilot with the pinned Meta checkpoint already cached:

```powershell
python software/ai/train/build_sft_data.py
python software/ai/train/fit_sft.py --output software/ai/train/runs/sft_v0
python software/ai/train/import_adapter.py --adapter-dir software/ai/train/runs/sft_v0 --staging-dir software/ai/artifacts/sft-v0-import --base-tag llama32-1b-meta-92131767:latest --tag llama32-1b-rocell-sft-v0:latest
python software/ai/run_offline.py evaluate-model --model llama32-1b-rocell-sft-v0:latest
```

Use a new `--output` and `--staging-dir` for each run. The importer stages the
adapter in an ignored folder with the filenames required by this Ollama
installation. Model weights, adapter weights, and raw run files are not
committed. This SFT pilot teaches the output contract from compiler-checked
labels; it is not teacher-logit distillation or evidence of robot typing.
